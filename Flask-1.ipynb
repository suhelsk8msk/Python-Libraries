    "Flask is a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require specific tools or libraries and does not come with built-in features such as database abstraction, authentication, and form validation. Instead, Flask allows developers to choose the tools and libraries they want to use, providing a flexible and modular approach to web development.\n",

    "1 - Simplicity: Flask is known for its simplicity and minimalistic design. It provides the essentials for building web applications without imposing unnecessary complexity. This makes it easy for beginners to learn and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Flexibility: Flask follows a \"micro\" philosophy, meaning it comes with only the bare essentials. Developers have the freedom to choose the components and libraries they need for their specific project requirements. This flexibility allows for a more customized and efficient development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Extensibility: Flask is designed to be easily extensible. There is a wide range of extensions available that can be integrated into your application to add features such as authentication, database support, and more. These extensions can be easily plugged in, contributing to the modular nature of Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - Jinja2 Templating: Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine, which provides a powerful and expressive way to create dynamic content in HTML templates. This separation of concerns between the application logic and presentation makes it easier to maintain and scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 - Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server that makes it easy to test and debug applications during the development phase. While this server is not suitable for production use, it is convenient for rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "6 - Active Community: Flask has a large and active community of developers. This means there is a wealth of tutorials, documentation, and third-party extensions available. The community support makes it easier for developers to find solutions to common issues and stay up-to-date with best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 - RESTful Support: Flask provides support for building RESTful APIs, making it a good choice for developing web services. It allows developers to create APIs that can be consumed by other applications or front-end frameworks."
