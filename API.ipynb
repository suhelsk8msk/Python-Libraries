    "1. Communication Style:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Uses a stateless communication model, where each request from the client to the server contains all the information needed to understand and process the request. There is no session state stored on the server between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP: Supports both stateful and stateless communication. It can maintain session state between requests if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Not a protocol but an architectural style. It typically relies on standard web protocols such as HTTP for communication.\n",

    "SOAP: A protocol that defines a set of rules and specifications for structuring messages and exchanging structured information. It often uses HTTP or SMTP as the transport layer.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "REST: Generally uses lightweight data formats like JSON or XML for message formatting. JSON is more commonly used in modern RESTful APIs.\n",

    "SOAP: Utilizes XML as the message format, which can be more verbose compared to JSON, leading to increased message size.\n",

    "4. Resource-Oriented vs. Operation-Oriented:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Follows a resource-oriented approach, where resources (identified by URIs) are manipulated using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP: Primarily focuses on operation-oriented services, providing a set of operations that can be performed on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "REST: Stateless communication, meaning each request is independent, and the server does not store any client state between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP: Supports both stateful and stateless communication. Stateful communication requires maintaining session information.\n",

    "\n",
    "REST: Known for its simplicity and ease of use. It is often chosen for its lightweight and flexible nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP: Can be more complex and requires adherence to a set of specifications. It may involve more boilerplate code and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Standardization:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: Less standardized, leading to more flexibility in implementation.\n",

    "REST: Often has more lightweight and straightforward tooling support. It is commonly used for modern web development and mobile applications.\n",
